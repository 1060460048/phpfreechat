  A free, simple, fast and customizable chat server

    Simple
         You only have to copy/paste 3 lines of code to have a nice
         working chat.
         No need to configure a database (Mysql), messages and nicknames are
         stored in files.
         No problems with firewall, this chat is based on HTTP so that you
         only need a web browser and an internet connection. (everybody can
         easily chat !)
         No problems with none latin characteres ! Are you Russian, Japanese,
         Turk, Chinese, or Arabic ? Whatever, phpfreechat will display nicely
         your characters because it uses XML with UTF8 to encode characters.

    Fast
         AJAX technology is used to smoothly refresh (no flicker) and display
         the chat zone and the nickname zone.
         Messages and nicknames are stored into a simple filesystem, so that
         server resources are saved to the uttermost.
         Bandwidth is preserved because the server never transmits twice the
         same data : only new messages are transmitted.
    Customizable
         You can write your own customized CSS stylesheets, to completely
         change the appearance of your chat.
         All chat functionalities are customizable. For example, you can
         change the messages refresh time, you can ban users for changing
         their usernames...
         The plugin system allows you to write your own storage routines.
         For example, you can write a plugin to store the conversations into
         your database.
    Opensource
         phpFreeChat is an opensource (LGPL) program, so that you can freely
         use it and modify it.
         I just ask, by gratitude, to keep the sign logo on the pages of your
         chat.

    All phpFreeChat commands are inspired by the irc protocol, and its
    interface is inspired by mIRC and XChat, so that users won't be
    disoriented.

    Techonologies used by phpFreeChat are :

       *  php : on the server side : conversations are simply stored in
          filesystems.
       *  xajax : for the asynchronous communication between the client
          and the server

    (phpFreeChat do NOT use mysql)
